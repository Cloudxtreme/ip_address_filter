IpAddressFilter
===============

This plugin can be used to restrict access to a controller to certain IP addresses. One can define a IP address and a Mask.

For example

class TestController < ApplicationController
	include IpAddressFilterSystem
	
	filter_ip_addresses "10.0.0.0", :allow_localhost => true, :mask => "255.255.0.0"
end

This ip address filter only allow ip addresses starting with "10.0" to access the methods in the controller.

The filter can be restricted to certain actions by adding :only, :except :for, :unless
